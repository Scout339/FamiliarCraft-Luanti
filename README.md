FamiliarCraft is a combination of recolored Voxelibre and original textures to look similar to Minecraft without reusing it's textures.

I have only officially tested this with Voxelibre, but hypothetically it should work with a plethora of other games, as I have attempted to focus on textures that have `mcl-core` in the name. With each update I try to focus on textures working from textures most commonly seen.
