FamiliarCraft is a combination of original and modified+recolored Pixel Perfection and Voxelibre textures to feel like Minecraft.

I have only officially tested this with Voxelibre, but hypothetically it should work with a plethora of other games, as I have attempted to focus on textures that have `mcl-core` in the name. I will never be able to finish all of the textures, so with each update I will atempt to focus on textures working from the most commonly seen downward.
